# Render Project Helper

A simple script to help keep Render projects up and running made using Render's official API.

## Steps to Get Started

1. Clone the project:  
   `git clone <repo-url>`

2. Go into the project directory:  
   `cd <your-project-directory>`

3. Run npm install in terminal:  
   `npm install`

4. Create a .env file:  
   `touch .env`

5. Go to account settings in Render and create an API key.

6. Add the API key to .env:  
   `API_KEY=potato`

7. Run the script:  
   `node index.js`

## Note

I recommend keeping the project in one location and simply saving the terminal command to run it. This way, you can quickly run it whenever you open the terminal again.
